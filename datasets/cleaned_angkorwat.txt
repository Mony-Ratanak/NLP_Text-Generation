for the largest temple at angkor, see angkor wat. angkor also known as yasodharapura was the capital city of the khmer empire, located in presentday cambodia. the city and empire flourished from approximately the 9th to the 15th centuries. the city houses the angkor wat, one of cambodias most popular tourist attractions. the name angkor is derived from nokor , a khmer word meaning kingdom which in turn derived from sanskrit nagara , meaning city. the angkorian period began in ad , when the khmer hindu monarch jayavarman ii declared himself a universal monarch and godking, and lasted until the late 14th century, first falling under ayutthayan suzerainty in . a khmer rebellion against siamese authority resulted in the sacking of angkor by ayutthaya, causing its population to migrate south to longvek. the alternate name, yasodharapura, was derived from the name of the foster mother of lord krishna in hinduism. hinduism was the largest religion in the ancient khmer empire, and many temples were constructed by khmer kings dedicated to hindu deities, including angkor wat. the ruins of angkor are located amid forests and farmland north of the great lake and south of the kulen hills, near modernday siem reap city , in siem reap province. the temples of the angkor area number over one thousand, ranging in scale from nondescript piles of brick rubble scattered through rice fields to the angkor wat, said to be the worlds largest single religious monument. many of the temples at angkor have been restored, and together, they comprise the most significant site of khmer architecture. visitors approach two million annually, and the entire expanse, including angkor wat and angkor thom is collectively protected as a unesco world heritage site. the popularity of the site among tourists presents multiple challenges to the preservation of the ruins. in , an international team of researchers using satellite photographs and other modern techniques concluded that angkor had been the largest preindustrial city in the world by surface area, with an elaborate infrastructure system connecting an urban sprawl of at least , square kilometres to the wellknown temples at its core. angkor is considered to be a hydraulic city because it had a complicated water management network, which was used for systematically stabilizing, storing, and dispersing water throughout the area. this network is believed to have been used for irrigation in order to offset the unpredictable monsoon season and to also support the increasing population. although the size of its population remains a topic of research and debate, newly identified agricultural systems in the angkor area may have supported between , and one million people. historical overview south gate into angkor thom angkor wat at sunrise seat of the khmer empire the angkorian period may have begun shortly after ad, when the khmer king jayavarman ii announced the independence of kambujadesa from java. according to sdok kok thom inscription, circa indrapura was the first capital of jayavarman ii, located in banteay prei nokor, near todays kompong cham. after he eventually returned to his home, the former kingdom of chenla, he quickly built up his influence, conquered a series of competing kings, and in became king of a kingdom called kambuja by the khmer. he then moved his court northwest to mahendraparvata, in present day kulen mountains, inland north from the great lake of tonle sap. he also established the city of hariharalaya at the northern end of tonl sap. through a program of military campaigns, alliances, marriages and land grants, he achieved a unification of the country bordered by china to the north, champa to the east, the ocean to the south and a place identified by a stone inscription as the land of cardamoms and mangoes to the west. in , jayavarman articulated his new status by declaring himself universal monarch and, in a move that was to be imitated by his successors and that linked him to the cult of siva, taking on the epithet of godking . before jayavarman, cambodia had consisted of a number of politically independent principalities collectively known to the chinese by the names funan and chenla. in , yasovarman ascended to the throne. a great king and an accomplished builder, he was celebrated by one inscription as a lionman he tore the enemy with the claws of his grandeur his teeth were his policies his eyes were the veda. near the old capital of hariharalaya, yasovarman constructed a new city, called yasodharapura, centered on the hill and temple of phnom bakheng. in the tradition of his predecessors, he also constructed a massive reservoir called baray. the significance of such reservoirs has been debated by modern scholars, some of whom have seen in them a means of irrigating rice fields, and others of whom have regarded them as religiously charged symbols of the great mythological oceans surrounding mount meru, the abode of the gods. the mountain, in turn, was represented by an elevated temple, in which the godking was represented by a lingam. in accordance with this cosmic symbolism, yasovarman built his central temple on a low hill known as phnom bakheng, surrounding it with a moat fed from the baray. he also built numerous other hindu temples and ashrams, or retreats for ascetics. over the next years, between and , the khmer empire produced some of the worlds most magnificent architectural masterpieces in the area known as angkor. most are concentrated in an area approximately miles east to west and miles north to south, although the angkor archaeological park, which administers the area, includes sites as far away as kbal spean, about miles to the north. some major temples or other buildings are found within this area, and the remains of several hundred additional minor temple sites are scattered throughout the landscape beyond. because of the lowdensity and dispersed nature of the medieval khmer settlement pattern, angkor lacks a formal boundary, and its extent is therefore difficult to determine. however, a specific area of at least , km2 beyond the major temples is defined by a complex system of infrastructure, including roads and canals that indicate a high degree of connectivity and functional integration with the urban core. in terms of spatial extent , this makes it the largest urban agglomeration in recorded history prior to the industrial revolution, easily surpassing the nearest claim by the maya city of tikal. at its peak, the city occupied an area greater than modern paris, and its buildings use far more stone than all of the egyptian structures combined. construction of angkor wat further information angkor wat suryavarman ii the single largest temple of the angkorian region, angkor wat, was built between and by king suryavarman ii. suryavarman ascended to the throne after prevailing in a battle with a rival prince. an inscription says that, in the course of combat, suryavarman leapt onto his rivals war elephant and killed him, just as the mythical birdman garuda slays a serpent. after consolidating his political position through military campaigns, diplomacy, and a firm domestic administration, suryavarman launched into the construction of angkor wat as his personal temple mausoleum. breaking with the tradition of the khmer kings, and influenced perhaps by the concurrent rise of vaisnavism in india, he dedicated the temple to vishnu rather than to siva. with walls nearly half a mile long on each side, angkor wat grandly portrays the hindu cosmology, with the central towers representing mount meru, home of the gods the outer walls, the mountains enclosing the world and the moat, the oceans beyond. the traditional theme of identifying the khmer devaraja with the gods, and his residence with that of the celestials, is very much in evidence. the measurements themselves of the temple and its parts in relation to one another have cosmological significance. suryavarman had the walls of the temple decorated with bas reliefs depicting not only scenes from mythology, but also from the life of his own imperial court. in one of the scenes, the king himself is portrayed as larger in size than his subjects, sitting crosslegged on an elevated throne and holding court, while a bevy of attendants make him comfortable with the aid of parasols and fans. panorama of angkor wat the main temple reflected in the northern reflection pond. angkor wat, siem reap, cambodia. jayavarman vii main article jayavarman vii a portrait of jayavarman vii on display at musee guimet, paris following the death of suryavarman around ad, the kingdom fell into a period of internal strife. its neighbors to the east, the cham of what is now southern vietnam, took advantage of the situation in to launch a waterborne invasion up the mekong river and across tonl sap. the cham forces were successful in sacking the khmer capital of yasodharapura and in killing the reigning king. however, a khmer prince who was to become king jayavarman vii rallied his people and defeated the cham in battles on the lake and on the land. in , jayavarman assumed the throne. he was to be the greatest of the angkorian kings. over the ruins of yasodharapura, jayavarman constructed the walled city of angkor thom, as well as its geographic and spiritual center, the temple known as the bayon. basreliefs at the bayon depict not only the kings battles with the cham, but also scenes from the life of khmer villagers and courtiers. jayavarman oversaw the period of angkors most prolific construction, which included building of the wellknown temples of ta prohm and preah khan, dedicating them to his parents. this massive program of construction coincided with a transition in the state religion from hinduism to mahayana buddhism, since jayavarman himself had adopted the latter as his personal faith. during jayavarmans reign, hindu temples were altered to display images of the buddha, and angkor wat briefly became a buddhist shrine. following his death, the revival of hinduism as the state religion included a largescale campaign of desecrating buddhist images, and continued until theravada buddhism became established as the lands dominant religion from the 14th century. zhou daguan the year marked the arrival at angkor of the chinese diplomat zhou daguan representing the yuan dynasty. zhous oneyear sojourn in the khmer capital during the reign of king indravarman iii is historically significant, because he penned a stillsurviving account, the customs of cambodia, of approximately forty pages detailing his observations of khmer society. some of the topics he addressed in the account were those of religion, justice, kingship, societal norms, agriculture, slavery, birds, vegetables, bathing, clothing, tools, draft animals, and commerce. in one passage, he described a royal procession consisting of soldiers, numerous servant women and concubines, ministers and princes, and finally, the sovereign, standing on an elephant, holding his sacred sword in his hand. together with the inscriptions that have been found on angkorian stelae, temples and other monuments, and with the basreliefs at the bayon and angkor wat, zhous journal is the most important source of information about everyday life at angkor. filled with vivid anecdotes and sometimes incredulous observations of a civilization that struck zhou as colorful and exotic, it is an entertaining travel memoir as well.
